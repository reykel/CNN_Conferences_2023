# CNN_Conferences_2023

Files used in my lectures concerning the development of Deep Learning solutions. 

They are all supported on Supervised Learning Models for image and video classification, as well as Time Series Forecasting. Using in every case Convolutional Neural Networks with different architectures and solution criteria. 

##For development was used: 
 - Python3 language
 - TensorFlow free library
 - Keras framework
 - Public datasets
The exercises were developed using the Google Colab tool.
